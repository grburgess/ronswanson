	abstract = {A new cluster resource management system called Simple Linux Utility Resource Management (SLURM) is described in this paper. SLURM, initially developed for large Linux clusters at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), is a simple cluster manager that can scale to thousands of processors. SLURM is designed to be flexible and fault-tolerant and can be ported to other clusters of different size and architecture with minimal effort. We are certain that SLURM will benefit both users and system architects by providing them with a simple, robust, and highly scalable parallel job execution environment for their cluster system.},

abstract = {{Astrophysical sources are now observed by many different instruments at different wavelengths, from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, with an unprecedented quality. Putting all these data together to form a coherent view, however, is a very difficult task. Each instrument has its own data format, software and analysis procedure, which are difficult to combine. It is for example very challenging to perform a broadband fit of the energy spectrum of the source. The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) aims to solve this issue, providing a common framework which allows for a coherent modeling of sources using all the available data, independent of their origin. At the same time, thanks to its architecture based on plug-ins, 3ML uses the existing official software of each instrument for the corresponding data in a way which is transparent to the user. 3ML is based on the likelihood formalism, in which a model summarizing our knowledge about a particular region of the sky is convolved with the instrument response and compared to the corresponding data. The user can choose between a frequentist analysis, and a Bayesian analysis. In the former, parameters of the model are optimized in order to obtain the best match to the data (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood). In the latter, the priors specified by the user are used to build the posterior distribution, which is then sampled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Multinest. Our implementation of this idea is very flexible, allowing the study of point sources as well as extended sources with arbitrary spectra. We will review the problem we aim to solve, the 3ML concepts and its innovative potential.}},

                  Interface Forum (MPIF), with participation from over 40
                  organizations, has been meeting since November 1992 to discuss
                  and define a set of library standards for message
                  passing. MPIF is not sanctioned or supported by any official
                  standards organization. The goal of the Message Passing
                  Interface, simply stated, is to develop a widely used standard
                  for writing message-passing programs. As such the interface
                  should establish a practical, portable, efficient and flexible
                  standard for message passing. , This is the final report,
                  Version 1.0, of the Message Passing Interface Forum. This
                  document contains all the technical features proposed for the
                  interface. This copy of the draft was processed by LATEX on
                  April 21, 1994. , Please send comments on MPI to
